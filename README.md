2) Problem 4.15 from the text: Submit a Colab notebook.
Assume a Gaussian stimulus distribution p(s) with mean 20 and standard deviation 4; this also serves as the prior distribution. The measurement distribution p(x|s) is Gaussian with a standard deviation σ = 5.

a) Draw 1000 values of s from the stimulus distribution. For each value of s, draw a single x from the measurement distribution p(x|s).
b) Scatter in a scatterplot the measurement x against the true stimulus s. In a separate scatterplot, scatter the posterior mean estimate against the true stimulus. Set your axes suitably. Draw the diagonal as a dashed black line. Draw a horizontal dashed black line at the prior mean.
c) Repeat (a) and (b) using σ = 1 instead of σ = 5. The two scatterplots should look very similar. Explain.
d) Repeat (a) and (b) using σ = 20. The first scatterplot should look very noisy, whereas the second one should look flat. Explain.
